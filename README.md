# nvidia2msikeyboard
Shows nVidia gpu usage on msi keyboard
Simple bash script which shows GPU usage in colors on the MSI gaming laptop console

Shows memory % used on the left, temperature in the middle, GPU utilisation on the right

I put it in cron, using crontab -e

The cron command is:
'* * * * *  col '
